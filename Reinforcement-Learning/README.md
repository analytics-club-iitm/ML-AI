## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
This type of an algorithm finds really good use cases in the field of robotics or in areas where you need to build a bot which can do a particular task for you intelligently.
The notebook given in the repository provides you with an introduction to the field of Reinforcement Learning
