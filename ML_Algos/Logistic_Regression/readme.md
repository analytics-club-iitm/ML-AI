# Logistic regression and implementing one from scratch

Hey guys, today we will be having a look at a simple algorithm for classification (i.e) Logistic regression. We will also be looking at how to implement one from scratch. 


Link to PDF which introduces you to the basic theory and some math behind this algorithm: [link](logistic_regression_repo_content.pdf)

## Task 

Visualize how the model finds the line/decision boundary to differentiate between the two classes in a binary classification problem at every iteration. Display each class with a unique color. If you feel confident you can even try to show this is an animation using matplotlib.
