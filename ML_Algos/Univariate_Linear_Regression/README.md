# Linear Regression

Hey everyone, so today we will be trying to understand how Linear Regression works and how to implement a simple univariate Linear Regression from scratch.

- Implementing from scratch [link](Linear-Regression%20Notebook.ipynb)

# Task 

Implement a simple multivariate Linear Regression using Numpy. In the example we showed, we had one X and a corresponding Y for every X. In the case of multivariate regression, there will be multiple features together called X and for each input there is a corresponding output Y. Link to [Dataset](data/multi.csv)

The Dataset contains 4 features and the corresponding output. Implement a simple Linear Regresion utilising all these 4 features by associating a corresponding variable for each to map them to the output variables.
