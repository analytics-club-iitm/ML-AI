## ML_Algos

This folder contains all the major Machine Learning Algorithms you'll need to know to effectively apply yourself to any Machine Learning problem.

The following supervised learning algorithms have been uploaded so far:
- [Linear Regression](Linear_Regression/)
- [Logistic Regression](Logistic_Regression/)

While [Overfitting and Underfitting](Overfit-Underfit/) are not exactly Machine Learning Algorithms, it is important to know about what problems can arise with Machine Learning models if trained for too long/less or if the data that's available is very less/a lot.
